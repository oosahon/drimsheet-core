## Design Pattern

### Pragmatic Functional OOP

- Domain entities, values, and pure rules should avoid side effects.
  Repositories and application services may perform controlled side effects
  such as persistence, cache claims, queueing, transactions, and reporting when
  those effects belong to their layer.
- Services should represent named capabilities with clear ownership. See
  [Service Philosophy](.agents/rules/service-philosophy.md) and
  [Service Ownership](.agents/rules/service-ownership.md).
- All similar functions are grouped in an immutable object.
- Function/Methods do not call external services directly. Dependencies are wired up in `index.ts` of each feature or sub-layer.\
  for example, `src/app/bookkeeping/usecases/index.ts` or `src/infra/services/index.ts`.

### Event-Driven Pattern and Immutability

- Domain entity creations or mutations MUST return both the new entity state and any corresponding domain events (e.g., `return [entity, events]`).
- Domain publishing is done on the application layer.

- **Strong Immutability**: All domain entities and state objects MUST be deeply frozen (e.g., using `deepFreeze()`) to prevent accidental mutations.\
  See `src/domain/journal-entry/entities/journal-entry.entity.ts` or `src/domain/ledger/entities/shared/ledger-account.entity.ts` for reference.

### Folder Structure

For the folder structure, we have favored Domain Driven Design.

> For a deeper architectural understanding of how these layers interact and the dependency rules between them, please read **[Section 5: Building Block View](docs/05_building_block_view.md)**.

Here are the top level folders you would find on the application:

```text

src/
├─ app/                 # Application layer: orchestrates use-cases, handles commands, maps data between domain and external interfaces
│  ├─ _bootstrap/       # Application bootstrap logic and server initialization
│  ├─ _internal/        # Internal-only application use cases
│  ├─ accounting/       # Accounting feature: dtos, handlers, mappers, use cases
│  ├─ auth/             # Authentication feature: contracts, dtos, errors, mappers, use cases
│  ├─ bookkeeping/      # Bookkeeping feature: contracts, dtos, handlers, mappers, use cases, workers

└─ shared/              # Shared utilities and types used across multiple layers
   ├─ __docs__/         # Shared documentation covering concepts like monetary values
   ├─ errors/           # Shared domain/application error types
   ├─ types/            # Global TypeScript types and interfaces
   ├─ utils/            # Helper functions, constants, and reusable utilities
   └─ value-objects/    # Shared value objects and related entities

```

## Domain Documentation

Contributors should see further documentations in the `__docs__` folder within the `domain` layer for the respective domains.

## Working with Money

- **Always use minor units**: Never use fractional values for money.
- **Use the Value Object**: Always run calculations through `moneyValue` (`src/shared/value-objects/money.vo.ts`).

For detailed documentation and examples on handling currency, see [`src/shared/__docs__/money.md`](src/shared/__docs__/money.md).

## Git Workflow

To maintain a clean and organized codebase, please follow these strict git workflow guidelines.

### Branching Strategy

- **`development`**: This is the main branch for development. All contributor Pull Requests (PRs) should be merged into `development`.
- **`main`**: This is the prerelease branch. Prerelease Pull Requests merge `development` into `main`, which deploys to staging for integration testing.
- **`release`**: This is the production branch. After this repository's prerelease succeeds, the approved `main` changes are promoted to `release`, which deploys to production.

### Feature Branches

- **Source**: Every new branch must be created off the `development` branch.
- **Target**: Every update must be submitted as a PR to the `development` branch.
- **Prerelease**: Open a PR from `development` to `main` after the contributor changes are ready for staging.
- **Release**: After the prerelease succeeds, promote the approved `main` changes to `release` through a PR.
- **Naming Convention**:
  - Branches should be named using the format: `<type>/<optional-issue-id>/<description-with-hyphens>`
  - **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `doc`
  - **Examples**:
    - `feat/49494/add-accounts-endpoint`
    - `fix/49494/login-error`

### Commit Messages & Pull Requests

We enforce a specific commit message format to generate clean changelogs and track history effectively.

- **Format**:
  ```text
  <type>(<domain>): <short description> <optional-id>
  ```
- **Rules**:
  - Pull request titles should also have the commit message structure.
  - PRs must be squashed and merged.
- **Examples**:
  - `feat(accounts): add endpoint to create account 3442`
  - `test(auth): improves smoke test`

## Testing

Our project follows these guidelines for testing:

- **Test Proximity**: Test files should be kept near their test subjects.
- **Dependency-free tests**: Domain tests, DTO tests, mapper tests, and `src/shared/**` tests use nearby `__tests__` folders with `.test.ts` files.
- **Dependency-bearing tests**: Other application, infrastructure, and interface tests use nearby `__specs__` folders with `.spec.ts` files.
- **Directory names**: Use plural test folders only: `__tests__` and `__specs__`.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: All E2E testing is handled in the frontend repository.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create a ticket for it on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/Drimsheet/drimsheet-core/issues).
Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues to see if it has already been reported.

- **Requirement**: Every bug report must have a corresponding ticket.
- **Format**: The ticket must clearly specify:
  1.  **Expected Behaviour**: What should happen.
  2.  **Current Behaviour**: What is actually happening.
