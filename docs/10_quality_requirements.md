# 10. Quality Requirements

This section defines the specific, measurable scenarios that prove Drimsheet meets the quality goals outlined in Section 1.2 and the architectural constraints defined in Section 2.

## 10.1 Quality Tree

The following quality tree breaks down the high-level quality goals into specific, measurable attributes for Drimsheet.

- **Data Integrity & Correctness**
  - **Immutability:** Journal entries are append-only after posting; never-posted Draft or Archived entries may be totally deleted, while system-generated reversals are always retained.
  - **ACID Compliance:** All double-entry postings must be perfectly balanced and atomically persisted.
  - **Compliance:** Full adherence to the Nigeria Tax Act (NTA) 2025 and core accounting principles.
- **Maintainability**
  - **Decoupling:** Business logic must remain isolated from interfaces, and tax rule logic must be versioned and separated from core ledgers.
  - **Testability:** Core accounting and taxation modules must maintain >85% automated test coverage.
- **Operability (Usability & Automation)**
  - **Abstraction:** The system must handle ledger setup and bookkeeping flows seamlessly for non-accountant users.
  - **Automation:** External integrations (e.g., Mono for bank feeds, FIRS for tax filings) must operate automatically with high resilience.
- **Security & Reliability**
  - **Access Control:** Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must isolate contexts for Sole Traders and Organizations.
  - **Agent Security:** External AI Agents communicating via MCP must operate strictly within bounded scopes.
  - **Idempotency:** Network calls to external APIs must be idempotent and traced via correlation IDs.

## 10.2 Quality Scenarios

The following scenarios describe how the Drimsheet system will react in specific situations to fulfill the quality goals defined above.

### Data Integrity & Correctness

1. **Journal Entry Modification (Immutability):**
   - **Stimulus:** An accountant user attempts to edit the monetary value of an already posted journal entry.
   - **System:** The repository layer intercepts the direct `UPDATE` or `DELETE` mutation.
   - **Response:** The system forces the user to post a reversing journal entry instead and logs the attempt in an immutable audit trail, ensuring 100% accounting transparency.

2. **Journal Entry Removal:**
   - **Stimulus:** A non-accountant removes a journal entry they previously recorded.
   - **System:** The journal-entry domain evaluates ownership, source type, status, posting history, and expected version before selecting removal behavior.
   - **Response:** A never-posted Draft or Archived entry is totally deleted without ledger work. A Posted or previously-posted Archived entry is retained as Voided and receives one balanced reversal. A reversal-source or already-Voided entry is rejected without mutation.

3. **Unbalanced Entry Detection (ACID Compliance):**
   - **Stimulus:** The core engine receives a journal-entry payload where the total debits do not equal the total credits (e.g., due to a client-side bug or misconfiguration).
   - **System:** The bookkeeping service processes the journal-entry payload.
   - **Response:** The system structurally rejects the journal-entry payload before reaching the database, preventing an invalid financial state, and returns a detailed validation error using standard domain formats.

4. **Tax Policy Evolution (Compliance):**
   - **Stimulus:** The Nigerian Government updates the standard VAT rate or introduces a new tax policy in the NTA.
   - **System:** The reporting/tax policy layer evaluates the versioned tax rules repository.
   - **Response:** Historical financial reports remain perfectly accurate according to the old rules, while new journals and reporting periods are computed using the new rules without requiring a database migration of historical data.

### Operability

5. **Non-Accountant Onboarding (Abstraction):**
   - **Stimulus:** A new individual user registers without any prior accounting knowledge.
   - **System:** The system evaluates the user's identity and active accounting entity context.
   - **Response:** The system automatically provisions a standard general ledger and sensible subledgers in the background. When the user creates an invoice, the system automatically handles the underlying double-entry postings (Accounts Receivable & Revenue) without requiring the user to know accounting terminology.

6. **External API Failure (Automation / Reliability):**
   - **Stimulus:** The FIRS Tax ProMax API becomes unresponsive while the system is attempting to automate a tax remittal.
   - **System:** The asynchronous worker evaluates the transient failure.
   - **Response:** The payload is safely routed to a dead-letter queue (DLQ) with exponential backoff logic, ensuring eventual consistency without failing the user's current bookkeeping session or losing the tax data.

### Security

7. **Cross-Domain Isolation (Access Control):**
   - **Stimulus:** A user who owns "Organization A" attempts to query financial reports using an ID belonging to "Organization B".
   - **System:** The request context and repository layer evaluate the authorized `x-accounting-entity-id` against the requested resource's metadata.
   - **Response:** The system immediately denies the request (403 Forbidden), guaranteeing zero cross-domain data leakage.

8. **AI Agent Operations (Agent Security):**
   - **Stimulus:** An autonomous AI Agent connecting via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) attempts to execute a destructive or highly sensitive operation (e.g., inviting a new accountant role).
   - **System:** The MCP interface validates the requested tool against the agent's authorized scopes.
   - **Response:** The system halts the operation and requests explicit human approval out-of-band before allowing the execution to proceed.
