## Chart of Accounts Structure

Our Chart of Accounts follows a **6-digit** hierarchical coding structure: **A-BB-CCC**. Where:

- **A** (1 digit) represents the primary account class (1=Asset, 2=Liability, 3=Equity, 4=Revenue, 5=Expense)
- **BB** (2 digits) represents the account group / sub-header (e.g. Cash and Cash Equivalents, Retained Earnings, etc.)
- **CCC** (3 digits) represents the control account or sub-ledger (sequentially allocated)

Codes are allocated through **Sequential Slotting** via the `getSubLedgerCode` function in `ledger-account.entity.ts`. Each new sub-ledger under a header receives the next available code (e.g., `100000` → `100001` → `100002`), with a 999-account limit per header.

Power users can set a display code for accounts, but the internal code will always follow the above structure.

## Metadata-Driven Account Behavior

Instead of hardcoding account behavior into the ledger codes (e.g. using a specific suffix digit for contra or adjunct accounts), PurpleLedger uses a **metadata-driven** architecture.

A ledger account's behavior and system constraints are defined by its properties in the database, as modeled in `ledger.types.ts`:

| Property             | Type                  | Purpose                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`               | `ULedgerType`         | Primary classification (Asset, Liability, Equity, Revenue, Expense)                                |
| `normalBalance`      | `UNormalBalance`      | Debit or Credit — auto-derived from `type`                                                         |
| `subType`            | string                | "What it is" — account classification within its type (e.g. `cash_and_cash_equivalent`, `payable`) |
| `behavior`           | string                | "How it acts" — operational semantics (e.g. `bank`, `petty_cash`, `tax_payable`)                   |
| `isControlAccount`   | boolean               | Whether this account is a Header Account or Control Account                                        |
| `controlAccountId`   | UUID \| null          | FK linking a sub-ledger to its Control Account                                                     |
| `contraAccountRule`  | `UContraAccountRule`  | Whether contra accounts are permitted, required, or prohibited                                     |
| `adjunctAccountRule` | `UAdjunctAccountRule` | Whether adjunct accounts are permitted, required, or prohibited                                    |
| `meta`               | object \| null        | Account-specific metadata (e.g. `IBankAccountMeta`, `IStatutoryPayableAccountMeta`)                |

### Adjustment Accounts (Contra & Adjunct)

Adjustment accounts are modeled relationally rather than via ledger code conventions. An adjustment account carries an `IAdjustmentMetaData` in its `meta` field:

```typescript
interface IAdjustmentMetaData {
  adjustmentType: UAdjustmentType; // 'contra' | 'adjunct'
  targetAccountId: TEntityId; // FK → basis account
}
```

This enables:

- A single basis account to have **multiple** contra accounts (e.g., Accumulated Depreciation AND Impairment Loss)
- Dynamic reporting adaptation without exhausting/reserving specific ledger code slots
- Clean separation between the account hierarchy and the adjustment relationship

> [!NOTE]
> For users who migrate from other systems, we will preserve their ledger codes at the DB level (`external_ledger_code`) but internally follow our strict nomenclature. Users can choose which code to display on the UI.

> [!NOTE]
> A more contrived view will be displayed for non-accountant users in the individual accounting domain. Nonetheless, under the hood, this will be the complete structure.

## Entity Architecture

Each ledger account type follows a consistent factory pattern:

1. **Type definitions** in `src/domain/ledger/types/` — progressive interface narrowing from `ILedgerAccount` → `I{Type}LedgerAccount` → `I{SubType}Account`
2. **Entity factories** in `src/domain/ledger/entities/{NN}-{type}-account/` — `make()` and `getCode()` functions
3. **Domain events** in `src/domain/ledger/events/` — emitted on every entity creation
4. **Shared factory** in `src/domain/ledger/entities/shared/ledger-account.entity.ts` — validates all base properties and constructs the frozen entity

Entity files are named by their COA prefix to make it explicit which accounts have been implemented and which are still pending:

```
01-asset-account/
├── cash-account.service.ts             ← 100xxx ✅
├── 02-receivables.entity.ts            ← 102xxx ✅
└── 99-suspense-account.entity.ts       ← 199xxx ✅
                                           101xxx (Short Term Investments) — not yet implemented
```
